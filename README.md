# Data Scientist – Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository showcases a curated collection of Machine Learning algorithms, systematically organized into Supervised and Unsupervised learning categories, each linked to its dedicated GitHub repository for in-depth exploration.

## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for predictions. It is divided into two main types:

### 1. Classification
- Decision Trees – [Decision Tree Repo](https://github.com/dharanisriravi/DECISION_TREE/blob/master/README.md)
- Random Forest – [Random Forest Repo](https://github.com/dharanisriravi/Random_forest_moel)
- SVM (Support Vector Machines) – [SVM Repo](https://github.com/dharanisriravi/SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINE)
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) – [KNN Repo](https://github.com/dharanisriravi/KNN_MODEL)
- Logistic Regression – [Logistic Regression Repo](https://github.com/dharanisriravi/LOGISTIC_MODEL)
- Naive Bayes – [Naive Bayes Repo](https://github.com/dharanisriravi/NAVIE_BAYES_MODEL)
- Gradient Boosting – [Gradient Boosting Repo]

### 2. Regression
- Linear Regression – [Linear Regression Repo]
- Ridge Regression – [Ridge Regression Repo]
- Lasso Regression – [Lasso Regression Repo]
- Elastic Net Regression – [Elastic Net Repo](https://github.com/dharanisriravi/ELASTIC_NET_REGRESSION)

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find patterns and relationships.

### 1. Clustering
- K-Means – [K-Means Repo](https://github.com/dharanisriravi/K_MEANS)
- Hierarchical Clustering – [Hierarchical Clustering Repo](https://github.com/dharanisriravi/HIERARCHICAL_CLUSTERING/blob/master/README.md)
- DBSCAN – [DBSCAN Repo](https://github.com/dharanisriravi/DBSCAN_MODEL)

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis) – [PCA Repo](https://github.com/dharanisriravi/PCA_MODEL)
